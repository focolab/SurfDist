This repo contains code for our SurfDist model. It is ported from [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) at commit [b4db0c9ab29a50f8dcae00023a9bd32bcc1b700c](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/commit/b4db0c9ab29a50f8dcae00023a9bd32bcc1b700c).

Bash scripts which were used for training on dataset [Worm](https://zenodo.org/records/5942575) using UCSF's [Wynton](https://wynton.ucsf.edu/hpc/index.html) cluster are available in the `wynton_scripts` directory.

Our best (by mean segmentaiton metrics across validation images) trained models are available at {placeholder}.
